prereq:
	know how IPC works:
		shared mem
		pipes (named and ordinary)

implementation:
	create basic tcp connection on local device (this would be same as IPC)
		check if it is working by sending a one line messege
		test using loops

	create a client.c file
		it accepts an IP address of a server
		returns the contents of index.html file
	
	using ports to connect to device as server (client and server scripts run on different devices)
		send one line messege 
		test using loops
		check for security issues
